# Pão de Queijo

Here it is! The recipe for the delicious Brasilian cheese buns that everybody ends up loving! They are gluten free which means that they are also a great hit with people that don't eat gluten. 

This recipe yields around 15 buns and can easily be multiplied in the same batch. There are a few things that need to be bought in special stores as they are not normal ingredients in Denmark. The *Tapioca granulada* is casava-starch in big grains. There is a company that imports this from Brazil and we founds that (this product)[https://www.tasteoflatinamerica.dk/dk/tapioca-granuleret-kassava-500g.html] works well. The other thing is the *Polvilho doce* or casava flour. From the same site it can be founds (here)[https://www.tasteoflatinamerica.dk/dk/sod-kassava-mel-polvilho-mandioca-doce-500-gr-glutenfri.html].
