# PhD

<p align="center"><img align="center" src="/assets/pics/PhD_frontpage.jpg" width="400"></p>

I started the PhD in September in 2021, handed it in in August 2024, and defended on the 11th of December 2024. If you are interested in how ML can be applied to solve problems in a coax-network, feel free to read my [PhD thesis](https://www.radismussen.dk/docs/tobias/PhD_Thesis.pdf).

## Why??

I have been asked multiple times why I chose to pursue the PhD and I have listed some of them here:
- I have always had a very curious nature and loved to investigate how things work
- I love to learn but also to teach
- I saw it as a good opportunity to develop myself and become more independent and better at structuring my own time
- I wanted to see if a career in academia was something for me

And I have definitely developed and learnt a lot about myself! And obviously good deal about coax-networks...
