# Pão de Queijo

Here it is! The recipe for the delicious Brasilian cheese buns that everybody ends up loving! They are gluten free which means that they are also a great hit with people that don't eat gluten.

This recipe yields around 15 buns and can easily be multiplied in the same batch. There are a few things that need to be bought in special stores as they are not normal ingredients in Denmark. The *Tapioca granulada* is casava-starch in big grains. There is a company that imports this from Brazil and we founds that [this product](https://www.tasteoflatinamerica.dk/dk/tapioca-granuleret-kassava-500g.html) works well. The other thing is the *Polvilho doce* or casava flour. From the same site it can be founds [here](https://www.tasteoflatinamerica.dk/dk/sod-kassava-mel-polvilho-mandioca-doce-500-gr-glutenfri.html).
For the cheese - a part of it can be substituted by another cheese. We have had success with for instance gouda.


## Ingredients

Yields around 15 buns

| Amount  | Ingredient |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 300 ml | Milk (letmælk 1.5% fat) |
| 50 ml | Oil (tasteless) |
| 2 tsp | Salt |
| 150 g | Tapioca granulada |
| 1 | Egg |
| 100 g | Grated parmesan cheese |
| 60 g | Polvilho doce |
|  | Grated parmesan cheese for roling |

## Instructions

1. Heat the **milk, oil** and **salt** up in a small saucepan until the mixture is boiling. Keep stiring to avoid the milk from burning on the bottom.
2. In a bowl mix the **tapioca granulada** with the hot milk-mixture. Stir occasionally until the mixture becomes grainy. Let the mixture cool down all the way so it becomes very stiff.
3. Add the **cheese, polvilho doce** and **egg** to the mixture and mix / kneed it well with your hands. A stand-mixture can easily be used for this purpose.
4. Roll the dough into small balls using your hands. The balls can optionally be rolled in more grated parmesan cheese. Place the balls on a baking tray with a bit of distance. The buns grow a bit when baked.
5. Bake in the oven at **180°C for 20-30 min.** or until they become a dark golden brown. You may have to rotate the baking tray at the halfway mark to get a consistent bake. The balls can also be kept in the freezer ready to bake.

If you can resist eating them straight off the baking tray, the buns can be kept in the fridge for up to two weeks and can easily be reheated.
