# Biscoito de Polvilho Salgado - Airy and salty beach snacks from Brazil

This recipe makes a big portion of the dough and turns into a lot (!) of snacks because their size increases drammatically during baking. The dough can however easily be prepared and saved in the fridge for later baking. The main ingredient for making the snacks comes from the cassava root and specifically the *polvilho azedo* flour (sour starch) that is gluten free. The recipe is based on the recipe from [this site](https://www.receiteria.com.br/receita/biscoito-de-polvilho-assado/) (in Portuguese).


## Ingredients

Yields around 10 baking trays of snacks (a lot).

| Amount  | Ingredient |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 500 g | Polvilho azedo (can be bought from *tasteoflatinamerica* e.g. [here](https://www.tasteoflatinamerica.dk/dk/sur-kassava-mel-polvilho-mandioca-azedo-500-gr-glutenfri.html) or [here](https://www.tasteoflatinamerica.dk/dk/sur-kassava-mel-polvilho-mandioca-azedo-500-gr-glutenfri.html)|
| 200 ml | Oil (tasteless) |
| 200 ml | Boiling water |
| 200 ml | Room temperature milk |
| 1 | Egg |
| 1 tsp | Salt |

## Instructions

1. Heat the **milk, oil** and **salt** up in a small saucepan until the mixture is boiling. Keep stiring to avoid the milk from burning on the bottom.
2. In a bowl mix the **tapioca granulada** with the hot milk-mixture. Stir occasionally until the mixture becomes grainy. Let the mixture cool down all the way so it becomes very stiff.
3. Add the **cheese, polvilho doce** and **egg** to the mixture and mix / kneed it well with your hands. A stand-mixture can easily be used for this purpose.
4. Roll the dough into small balls using your hands. The balls can optionally be rolled in more grated parmesan cheese. Place the balls on a baking tray with a bit of distance. The buns grow a bit when baked.
5. Bake in the oven at **180Â°C for 20-30 min.** or until they become a dark golden brown. You may have to rotate the baking tray at the halfway mark to get a consistent bake. The balls can also be kept in the freezer ready to bake.

If you can resist eating them straight off the baking tray, the buns can be kept in the fridge for up to two weeks and can easily be reheated.
