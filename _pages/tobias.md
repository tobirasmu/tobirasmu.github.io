I am a Danish man living in Copenhagen and working in Lyngby as a PhD student at DTU Compute. I am currently researching machine learning and mathematical modelling and how machine learning can be used to solve different problems in broadband networks, but I am by nature a very curious guy that has a great interest in many different topics. I have also been playing curling since I was 12 years old, which has given me many amazing experiences. I love to see the world, which I have also been able to do on numerous occations in relation to my sport and to my semesters abroad, studying in North America.

## Bio

I am originally a "jyde" which is a guy coming from Jutland. I was born in Aarhus, but grew up in the middle of Jutland in a city called Silkeborg. In 2015 I moved to Kongens Lyngby (just north of Copenhagen) for my undergraduate studies in applied mathematics at the Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.dtu.dk)). I have been studying / working at DTU ever since. In 2021 I started my [PhD project](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/phd/current-phd/phd-stat/tobias-engelhardt-rasmussen) at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk) which is still going on. You can read much more about my studies and work at DTU on the following pages. Here is an overview of my education history - you can also check out my full [CV](https://www.radismussen.dk/docs/tobias/CV.pdf):

- **[BSc]** - Mathematics and Technology at DTU - 2015 to 2019
  - Exchange Semester at McGill University in Montréal, Québec, Canada in the fall of 2017
- **[MSc]** - Mathematical Modelling and Computation at DTU - 2019 to 2021
- **[PhD]** - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Field Service - 2021 to 2024 (ongoing)
  - External stay at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA in the Spring of 2023
