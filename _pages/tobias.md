# Tobias Engelhardt Rasmussen

I am a former "jyde" which is a guy coming from Jutland. I was born in Aarhus, but grew up in the middle of Jutland in a city called Silkeborg. In 2015 I moved to Kongens Lyngby (just north of Copenhagen) for my undergraduate studies in applied mathematics at the Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.dtu.dk)). I have been studying / working at DTU ever since. In 2021 I started my [PhD project](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/phd/current-phd/phd-stat/tobias-engelhardt-rasmussen) at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk) which is still going on. You can read much more about my studies and work at DTU on the following pages. Here is an overview of my education history - you can also check out my full [CV](https://www.radismussen.dk/docs/tobias/CV.pdf):

- **[BSc]** - Mathematics and Technology at DTU
  - Exchange Semester at McGill University in Montréal, Québec, Canada.
- **[MSc]** - Mathematical Modelling and Computation at DTU
- **[PhD]** - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Field Service
  - External stay at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA
