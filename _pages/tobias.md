I am a Danish man living in Copenhagen and working as a Data Scientist at Banedanmark where I work with developing and maintaning ML models to help run the Danish train traffic. I have a PhD degree from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). During my PhD studies I was researching machine learning and mathematical modelling and how machine learning can be used to solve different problems in broadband networks and specifically using time series data. By nature I am a very curious guy that has a great interest in many different topics. I have also been playing curling since I was 12 years old, which has given me many amazing experiences. I love to see the world, which I have also been able to do on numerous occations in relation to my sport and to my semesters abroad, studying in North America.

## Bio

I am originally a "jyde" which is a guy coming from Jutland, where grew up right in the middle in a city called Silkeborg. In 2015 I moved to Kongens Lyngby (just north of Copenhagen) for my undergraduate studies in applied mathematics at the Technical University of Denmark ([DTU](https://www.dtu.dk)). I was studying / working at DTU until I finished my PhD in December 2024. In 2021 I started my [PhD project](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/projects/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-in-field-service) at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk) which I finished and defended in 2024. You can read much more about my studies and work at DTU on the following pages. Here is an overview of my education history - you can also check out my full [CV](https://www.radismussen.dk/docs/tobias/CV_tobias.pdf):

- **[BSc]** - Mathematics and Technology at DTU - 2015 to 2019
  - Exchange Semester at McGill University in Montréal, Québec, Canada in the fall of 2017
- **[MSc]** - Mathematical Modelling and Computation at DTU - 2019 to 2021
- **[PhD]** - Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis for Optimization and Anomaly Detection in Field Service - 2021 to 2024
  - External stay at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, USA in the Spring of 2023
